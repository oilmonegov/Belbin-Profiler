            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                The Belbin Team Role Inventory assesses how an individual behaves in a team environment. It is therefore a behavioural tool, subject to change, and not a psychometric instrument. The assessment includes 360-degree feedback from observers as well as the individual's own evaluation of their behaviour, and contrasts how they see their behaviour versus how their colleagues do.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                Unlike the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is a psychometric instrument used to sort people into one of 16 personality types, the Belbin Inventory scores people on how strongly they express behavioural traits from 9 different Team Roles. An individual may and often does exhibit strong tendencies towards multiple roles. Belbin himself asserts that the Team Roles are not equivalent to personality types.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                Dr. Meredith Belbin first began studying teams at Henley Management College in the 1970s. Over a period of ten years, Belbin carried out extended observational research to determine which factors influenced team failure or success. A management game was designed to reproduce work life. It contained all the principal variables that typify the problems of decision-making in a business environment. The experiment was designed along scientific lines with careful measurement at each stage.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                Those participating were invited to take a battery of psychometric tests and teams were assembled on the basis of test scores. At first, Belbin hypothesised that high-intellect teams would succeed where lower intellect teams would not. However, the outcome of this research was that certain teams, predicted to be excellent based on intellect, failed to fulfil their potential. In fact, it became apparent by looking at the various combinations that it was not intellect, but balance, which enabled a team to succeed. The most successful companies tended to be those with a mix of different people, i.e. those with a range of different behaviours. In fact, eight distinct clusters of behaviour turned out to be distinctive and useful, with the balance required dependent on the purpose and objectives of the team.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                The Belbin Team Inventory first appeared in Meredith Belbin's book, "Management Teams: Why They Succeed or Fail" (1981). The inventory is protected by Belbin's copyright and cannot be reproduced in any form. Additionally, it is not normed, lacks the Specialist role and the benefit of feedback from colleagues and does not offer Team Role feedback. Much early research is based upon this now obsolete version of the inventory.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                Belbin now administers the refined Belbin Team Inventory via e-interplace, a computerised system which scores and norms the data to produce feedback reports for individuals, teams, groups and jobs. Meredith Belbin argues that the optimum size for a team is 4 people. Beyond this number, individuals do not work closely enough together to constitute a team and are defined as a group.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-4">
                Data from the Belbin Team Inventory can also be amalgamated and interpreted to assess how effectively a team is likely to work together, including selecting the best candidate to fulfill each role, and identifying gaps and overlaps in the Team Role distribution which might have an impact on a team's success. The Belbin Team Inventory can also be used in conjunction with the Belbin Job Requirements Inventory to assess a candidate's behavioural performance in a particular job.
